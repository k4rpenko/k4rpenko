## What's up / my name is Dayvid or just David!

A little bit about me:

I am a software developer with a passion for building complete solutions. I've worked with a variety of technologies, from ASP.NET and .NET to Angular, React, and Next.js. Whether it's TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, or SASS, I'm as comfortable writing front-end magic as I am working with complex back-end logic.

I've worked with Docker, Redis, and a variety of databases including SQL/NoSQL (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server) to make sure my applications run smoothly, even under pressure. If there's a database or architecture issue, I've likely seen it before - or at least I've debugged it with lots of coffee.

I've also had hands-on experience with Python, C++, and Node.js, so my toolkit is well developed. I'm currently diving into RabbitMQ for message queues, experimenting with .NET MAUI for cross-platform applications, and learning Python/Django because why not learn a little more backend?
